Ricardo Baeza-Yates is the director of research for Experiential AI at Northeastern University. With decades of experience spanning algorithms, information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, and responsible AI, Ricardo offers a wealth of knowledge to our discussion. He elaborates on the necessity of Earth-centered AI, emphasizing the important connection between technology and environmental sustainability. Ricardo underscores the urgency of evaluating the impacts of AI on both human society and our planet, advocating for principled evaluations and minimized harms in AI's deployment.

A major theme that emerges from our conversation is the importance of integrating ethical considerations and multidisciplinary approaches in AI development. Ricardo argues against the simplistic inclusion of "humans in the loop," instead advocating for humans to be in charge, ensuring more control and responsibility in AI processes. He envisions a future where AI empowers individuals by taking over tasks that people find tedious, thereby enhancing overall well-being and productivity. Ricardo's insights resonate deeply with the mission of HCAI, shedding light on the need for AI systems that empower people and promote security, fairness, and environmental consciousness.
